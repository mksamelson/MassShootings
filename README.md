Visualization and Analysis of Mother Jones Magazine Mass Shooting Data

This repository contains:

A csv file with Mother Jones Magazine Mass Shooting data

An R file in which charts and figures were generated principally using the ggplot2 library.

An .rmd file used with the Knitr package to generate an html presentation.

An html presentation file

Various image files in jpg and pgn format that were saved from the R file and imported into the .rmd file to generate the presentation.

If you want to view the presentation simply open the html file.  The R file and the .rmd file open in RStudio.  Be sure to add the knitr library in RStudio if you want to play with the .rmd file.

Here is a link to an on line write up on this analysis:
